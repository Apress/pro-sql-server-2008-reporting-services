    The examples in this chapter depend on the proper initial setup and configuration
    of your system. It will also use the same database that was used in previous
    chapters.<br />
    <br />
    This example was designed to all be run off the same system with references set
    to localhost for the database and localhost for the report server. If this doesn't match
    your configuration you will need to update the datasources and the deployment URLs
    in the Reports project of the solution. Change the datasources SQL server by editing
    it directly in the datasource, edit the properties of the Reports project to set
    the URLS. You should also update the SSRSWebService Web Reference by right
    clicking and selecting Update Web Reference. Set the Web Reference URL in its properties
    first if SQL Reporting Services 2008 is running on a server other than localhost.<br />
    <br />
    In order to run the examples in this chapter you will need to copy the Employee.xml
    file that appears in the Solutions Solution Items folder (located on disk in the
    Solutions Data Files folder) to C:\Temp\. You will also need to be sure that
    these files have the proper access permissions.<br />
    <br />
    You will need to deploy the report and datasource to your SSRS 2008 server before
    you can run the viewer examples.<br />
